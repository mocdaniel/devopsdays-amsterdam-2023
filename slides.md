# The paradox of choice

* Too many choices can lead to decision paralysis

* *more* becomes *less*

* People are afraid of making the wrong choice

What technology do I need to look at *right now*? What does my tool have to *do*?

*Boring* often means *adopted*. Adopted means *supported*. Other parts of the puzzle will fall into place.
